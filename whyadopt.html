    <h2> Top reasons to adopt: </h2>
    <div>
    <h3 class="reasons"> 1. Because you will save a life. </h3>
    <h4 class="reasonpoints">The animals that are left on the streets are mistreated and abused on a daily basis. If you decide to adopt, you will be saving a life. </h4>
    <h3 class="reasons"> 2. Because they bring more happiness to you than you to them. </h3>
    <h4 class="reasonpoints">You will know the happiness that a pet brings to you only when you adopt one of your own. Personally, time with my pet is all the therapy I need to get through the day. </h4>
    <h3 class="reasons"> 3. Because it will cost you less than buying one.</h3>
    <h4 class="reasonpoints">Buying a pet can be very expensive. But adopting a pet does not cost a thing.</h4>
    <h3 class="reasons"> 4. Because all pets are good for your health, but adoptees offer an extra boost.</h3>
    <h4 class="reasonpoints">Animals not only provide unconditional love, but they have also been found to benefit their companions psychologically, emotionally, and physically. Caring for a pet can give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment, as well as help you feel less lonely. You can also feel good about helping an animal in need when you adopt!</h4>
