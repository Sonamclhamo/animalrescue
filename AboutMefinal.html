      <h1>Animal Cruelty needs to stop</h1>
      <p class="aboutmeparagraph"> According to research done by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in 2021, by the time you finish reading this article, 10 animals will be abused. The same study showed that 10 million animals in the US are abused to death annually. This list includes birds, fish, monkeys, and pigs. This list does not include all the lab rats that are being tested by companies for various unethical purposes. However, when we talk about animal cruelty and abuse, we only think of wild and stray animals and not our pet animals. Pets at home are also prone to domestic violence by their owners and it is a huge concern. Since these animals cannot speak for themselves, we need to pay extra attention to their needs. Adoption is the best way to give home to those stray animals that are mistreated on the streets. </p>

      <h1> About me</h1>
      <p class="border"> My name is Sonam Choki Lhamo. A teacher by profession but an animal lover by choice. I want to create awareness on animal cruelty and make sure our friends are safe with us. I have a pet dog of my own and I know how capable animals can be eventhough they cannot talk. It breaks my heart to see the amount of abuse that animals endure not only in other countries but in Bhutan as well. </p>
